	print employee_name + """, \n \nI received your resume from """ + employer_name + " at " + employer_company + """ and thought your background was an excellent match to a """ + title + """ position we are recruiting for. This would initially be a """ + contract_length + """ contract with our client in Birmingham, AL, but the position is open for renewal.  If you are interested, I would like to set up a time where we could speak over Skype, perhaps 10-15 minutes to talk about the position and go over your experience in further detail. Please let me know when would be a good time for you.  Thanks and have a great day!"""
